- Implemented safer file operations with proper error handling
- Added ImageProcessingError exception type
- Added utility function for retrying operations with backoff
- Enhanced image validation with better error reporting
- Improved filename generation with better duplicate prevention

### 3. Centralized Tag Management
- Created `core/tagging.py` for all tag-related operations
- Implemented consistent tag normalization
- Added proper error handling with TaggingError exception
- Enhanced tag search functionality
- Added batch operations for tag updates
- Implemented case-sensitive and case-insensitive search options

### 4. Streamlined Core Filesystem Module
- Refactored `core/filesystem.py` to remove duplicated functionality
- Enhanced file path sanitization for security
- Added helper functions for common file operations
- Improved directory validation and setup

### 5. Enhanced API Models with Validation
- Expanded and consolidated API models in `models/api.py`
- Added validation for all model fields
- Created comprehensive error response models
- Added request validation with detailed error messages
- Enhanced security with input validation
- Implemented batch operation models

### 6. Improved WebSocket Communication
- Enhanced the WebSocket connection manager
- Added reconnection support and heartbeat mechanism
- Implemented proper message validation
- Created structured message handling
- Added client tracking with statistics
- Implemented automatic cleanup of stale connections
- Added broadcast capability with error handling

### 7. Implemented Graceful Shutdown
- Added signal handlers for SIGINT and SIGTERM
- Implemented session saving during shutdown
- Added notification to connected clients about shutdown
- Created proper resource cleanup during shutdown
- Integrated shutdown event system

### 8. Created Integration Testing
- Added `test/test_integration.py` for end-to-end workflow testing
- Created a comprehensive test that validates the complete workflow
- Verified interaction between different modules
- Added session persistence testing
- Validated session loading/saving functionality

## Code Organization

The project has been restructured to follow a more modular design:
