# Step 9: Test with Sample Image Directories

## Overview
In this step, we'll conduct comprehensive testing of the application using real image directories. This testing phase is crucial for identifying any issues in real-world usage scenarios and ensuring the application works as expected with various image types, quantities, and folder structures.

## Requirements
- Create diverse test datasets with different image types and quantities
- Test all application functionalities in real-world scenarios
- Identify and fix any bugs or performance issues
- Validate the application's behavior with edge cases
- Ensure consistent performance across different environments
- Document any limitations or known issues

## Implementation Details

### Test Dataset Creation

#### Sample Image Sets
1. **Small Dataset (10-20 images)**
   - Various image formats (JPG, PNG, GIF, etc.)
   - Mix of image sizes and dimensions
   - Some with existing text files, some without

2. **Medium Dataset (50-100 images)**
   - Organized in a simple flat directory
   - Consistent naming pattern
   - All common image formats

3. **Large Dataset (200+ images)**
   - Test scalability and performance
   - Mix of high and low resolution images
   - Various aspect ratios

4. **Nested Directory Dataset**
   - Images in subdirectories
   - Test recursive scanning capability (if implemented)
   - Mixed formats and sizes

5. **Edge Case Dataset**
   - Images with special characters in filenames
   - Very large images (10+ MB)
   - Very small images (thumbnails)
   - Non-standard image formats

### Testing Categories

#### Functional Testing
- Verify all features work as expected:
  - Command-line argument parsing
  - Directory scanning and validation
  - Image renaming and copying
  - Tag management
  - Session persistence
  - GUI functionality
  - Save/exit and resume

#### Performance Testing
- Measure and optimize:
  - Image loading speed
  - GUI responsiveness with large tag sets
  - Memory usage with large image sets
  - Session state saving/loading performance
  - Overall application startup time

#### Edge Case Testing
- Test behavior with:
  - Empty directories
  - Directories with no valid images
  - Very large images
  - Corrupted image files
  - Images with unusual aspect ratios
  - Special characters in filenames and tags

#### User Experience Testing
- Evaluate:
  - Intuitiveness of tag selection
  - Visibility of image preview
  - Clarity of progress indicators
  - Ease of navigation between images
  - Feedback for user actions

### Testing Methods

#### Manual Testing
- Interactive testing of GUI components
- Step-by-step verification of workflows
- Validation of visual elements and layouts

#### Automated Testing
- Unit tests for core functions
- Integration tests for component interactions
- End-to-end tests for complete workflows
- Performance benchmarks

#### Error Injection
- Deliberately introduce errors to test recovery:
  - Remove session files during processing
  - Corrupt image files
  - Introduce invalid tags
  - Simulate disk space issues

### Test Documentation

#### Test Cases
- Detailed descriptions of test scenarios
- Expected outcomes for each test
- Actual results and pass/fail status
- Reproducible steps for failures

#### Issue Tracking
- Log all discovered issues
- Categorize by severity and component
- Track resolution status
- Document workarounds for known issues
