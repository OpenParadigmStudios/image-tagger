# Step 4: Server Implementation with FastAPI (Completed)

## Overview
In this step, we implemented a web server using FastAPI to serve the CivitAI LoRA Tagging Assistant application. The server provides endpoints for image listing, image viewing, and WebSocket communication for real-time tagging. This builds on the file system operations and image processing functionality from previous steps by exposing them through a web interface.

## Implementation Details

### Core Components Implemented

#### 1. API Routers
We created a modular architecture with three main routers:

1. **Images Router**: Handles image-related operations
   - List all images in the input directory
   - Get information about specific images
   - Serve image files securely
   - Get and update tags for images

2. **Tags Router**: Manages tag operations
   - Get all tags from the master tags list
   - Add new tags to the master list
   - Delete tags from the master list

3. **WebSocket Router**: Provides real-time communication
   - Handle WebSocket connections with clients
   - Process real-time tagging operations
   - Send notifications about processing status

#### 2. Main Server Application
- Created a global FastAPI application instance
- Set up static file serving for web client files
- Configured middleware and routes
- Implemented application state management
- Added graceful shutdown handling

#### 3. Connection Management
- Implemented a ConnectionManager class to handle WebSocket connections
- Added methods for connecting, disconnecting, and message broadcasting
- Created handlers for different message types from clients
- Implemented error handling for WebSocket communications

#### 4. Server-Side Session Management
- Integrated session state tracking with the web interface
- Implemented session state synchronization across clients
- Added real-time updates when images are processed

### API Endpoints
The following API endpoints were implemented:

- `GET /`: Serves the main web interface
- `GET /api/status`: Returns the current application status
- `GET /api/images/`: Lists all images with pagination
- `GET /api/images/{image_id}`: Gets information about a specific image
- `GET /api/images/{image_id}/file`: Serves an image file
- `GET /api/images/{image_id}/tags`: Gets tags for a specific image
- `PUT /api/images/{image_id}/tags`: Updates tags for an image
- `GET /api/tags/`: Gets all tags from the master list
- `POST /api/tags/`: Adds a new tag to the master list
- `DELETE /api/tags/{tag_name}`: Deletes a tag from the master list
- `WebSocket /ws`: Handles real-time communication

### WebSocket Message Types
The following WebSocket message types were implemented:

- `session_state`: Sends initial session state to clients
- `ping`/`pong`: Connection health checks
- `get_image`: Requests image data
- `image_data`: Returns requested image data
- `update_tags`: Updates tags for an image
- `tags_updated`: Confirms tags were updated
- `save_session`: Requests session state saving
- `session_saved`: Confirms session was saved
- `error`: Communicates errors to clients
- `session_update`: Broadcasts session state changes to all clients

### Code Organization
The server code is organized into the following structure:

```
server/
  ├── __init__.py
  ├── main.py              # Main FastAPI application
  └── routers/             # API route definitions
      ├── __init__.py
      ├── images.py        # Image-related endpoints
      ├── tags.py          # Tag management endpoints
      └── websocket.py     # WebSocket handling
```

## Integration with Previous Steps
- Utilized the file system operations from Step 2
- Built on image processing functions from Step 3
- Extended configuration parsing from Step 1
- Maintained the same session state structure

## Testing
The server functionality can be tested by:
- Starting the application with the input directory parameter
- Navigating to the web interface in a browser
- Testing API endpoints with browser or API testing tools
- Verifying WebSocket communication works correctly

## Next Steps
Having completed the server implementation, we can now proceed to Step 5: Develop Tag Management System with API. This will enhance the tag management capabilities and connect them more deeply with the web client interface.

## Files Created/Modified
1. `server/routers/__init__.py` - Package initialization
2. `server/routers/images.py` - Image handling router
3. `server/routers/tags.py` - Tag management router
4. `server/routers/websocket.py` - WebSocket communication router
5. `server/main.py` - Main server application (updated)
6. `main.py` - Entry point (already existed)

## Challenges and Solutions
1. **Integration with existing code**: Carefully refactored the existing file system and image processing code to work with the web-based approach
2. **Real-time communication**: Implemented WebSocket handling for real-time updates between server and clients
3. **State management**: Created a centralized application state accessible to all API endpoints
4. **Security**: Added validation to prevent directory traversal and other security issues
5. **Error handling**: Implemented comprehensive error handling throughout the API
