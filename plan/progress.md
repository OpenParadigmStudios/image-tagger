- Documented IDE setup in plan/ide_setup.md

### Architecture Change

#### Migration to Web-Based Interface
- Evaluated project requirements and development progress
- Decided to migrate from PyQt6-based desktop application to web-based interface
- Created migration plan in plan/migration_plan.md
- Updated project.md with new web-based approach
- Changed requirements.txt to replace PyQt6 with FastAPI, Uvicorn, and WebSockets
- Updated all step files to reflect the new architecture
- Enhanced development.md with web development guidelines
- Modified architecture to use client-server model with WebSockets
- Updated testing strategy to include web-specific testing
- Added security considerations for web-based application

### In Progress

None - Waiting to proceed to Step 6 with the web-based approach.

### Pending Steps

- Step 6: Create Web Client Interface
- Step 7: Complete Integration and Workflow
- Step 8: Testing with sample image directories
- Step 9: Refinement based on testing feedback
