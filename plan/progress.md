# CivitAI Flux Dev LoRA Tagging Assistant - Progress

## Project Progress

### Completed Steps

#### Step 1: Command Line Argument Parsing
- Created basic application structure
- Implemented command line argument parsing using argparse
- Added validation for input directory
- Implemented basic output directory creation
- Set up logging system with verbosity control
- Created AppConfig dataclass for configuration management
- Added unit tests for argument parsing functionality
- Created documentation in README.md

#### Step 2: File System Operations
- Implemented image file scanning with proper validation
- Created SessionState dataclass for tracking processing state
- Added JSON-based session state persistence with safe file operations
- Implemented tag file management with duplicate detection
- Added backup functionality for data safety
- Created detailed unit tests for all file system operations
- Enhanced error handling and recovery mechanisms
- Added support for resuming previous sessions
- Updated requirements documentation

#### Project Configuration Updates
- Set up UV package manager for dependency management
- Created requirements.txt with initial dependencies
- Set up virtual environment with UV
- Added documentation for UV setup
- Created development.md for tracking development conventions
- Updated README.md with UV usage instructions
- Configured Cursor IDE to use the UV virtual environment
- Created .vscode/settings.json for consistent IDE configuration
- Added .python-version for Python version management
- Created activation script for easy environment setup
- Added .gitignore file to exclude generated files
- Documented IDE setup in plan/ide_setup.md

### Architecture Change

#### Migration to Web-Based Interface
- Evaluated project requirements and development progress
- Decided to migrate from PyQt6-based desktop application to web-based interface
- Created migration plan in plan/migration_plan.md
- Updated project.md with new web-based approach
- Changed requirements.txt to replace PyQt6 with FastAPI, Uvicorn, and WebSockets
- Updated all step files to reflect the new architecture
- Enhanced development.md with web development guidelines
- Modified architecture to use client-server model with WebSockets
- Updated testing strategy to include web-specific testing
- Added security considerations for web-based application

### In Progress

None - Waiting to proceed to Step 3 with the new web-based approach.

### Pending Steps

- Step 3: Build image renaming and copying functionality
- Step 4: Server Implementation with FastAPI
- Step 5: Develop Tag Management System with API
- Step 6: Create Web Client Interface
- Step 7: Complete Integration and Workflow
- Step 8: Testing with sample image directories
- Step 9: Refinement based on testing feedback

## Next Steps

Proceed to Step 3: Build image renaming and copying functionality, which will include:
- Creating unique identifiers for each image
- Copying/moving images to the output directory with new names
- Creating corresponding .txt files for each image
- Tracking renamed files in the session state
- Implementing proper error handling for file operations
- Replacing the deprecated imghdr module with Pillow-based validation
- Designing functions to be callable from FastAPI endpoints
